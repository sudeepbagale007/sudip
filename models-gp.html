<div class="conclusion">
	<h2>7.MyExperience</h2>
	The experience in designing own portfolio was quite learningful for me. During this session i build the basic 
	concepts of HTML and CSS. The main focus of mine in this session was to design the portfolio using material design 
	and make it campotible in different devices like mobiles, laptops, tablets, etc. Learning and doing the assingment together was quite fruitful for me. The  concepts which i wasn't clear in the class, i made it clear during this session. In this term, i learned some basic concepts like flex properties, animations, transistions, Google API fonts,CSS selectors  etc and their functions in respective postions. Mobile responsive term worked very well in my project. The interference and colors used in the site are user friendly. Use of appropriate fontsize  and proper color variations on the site made user to read the contents of the page more easier. As i have the  knowlege in php also, if there was  a bit of more time, i woulld have used php in the site and made it to work with the local host. CSS doesnt provide more animation options, using it it is difficult to make the objects animate with more options. As we will learn Javascript in second term, If i had knowlege about it, i would use more attractive animation options to follow google material design concepts.
